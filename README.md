## 🌞 Current Research
![amoc_simulations](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0f7f5685-fce0-4477-84ed-f55d71b74421)
🌊 **Master’s Thesis (in progress)**  
**Topic:** Application of **rare event algorithms** to internal atmospheric variables for analyzing AMOC response using the coupled model **PlaSim-LSG**  
- Developed and validated model climatologies against reanalysis datasets  
- Designed custom atmospheric state indices to explore extreme trajectories toward AMOC collapse  
- Applied a rare event sampling algorithm to improve detection of low-probability/high-impact transitions

🌩 **ML for SST Anomalies Forecasting**  
A project comparing **LSTM** and **MLP** networks to predict Sea Surface Temperature anomalies using **EOF decomposed ERA5** data  
- Involved preprocessing (seasonal decomposition, PACF), model design, training, and evaluation  
- LSTM outperformed MLP, showing better handling of complex temporal dependencies
